Project Overview

This e-commerce platform has been designed with the following key functionalities:

- User Authentication & Authorization: Allow users to register, login, and manage their profile. Admins can manage product listings and view all orders.
- Product Management: Users can view, search, and filter products. Admins can add, update, and delete product listings.
- Shopping Cart: Users can add products to their cart, modify quantities, and remove items.
- Checkout & Payment: Secure checkout process using Stripe to process payments.
- Order Management: Users can view order history and order details.
- Admin Dashboard: Admins can access an overview of all orders and product management options.
- Security Features: The application includes JWT authentication, input validation, sanitization, and rate-limiting to protect the system from abuse.

------------------------------------------------------------

Tech Stack

Frontend:
- React.js: A powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Vite: A fast, modern, and highly optimized bundler for React apps.
- React Router: For navigation between pages.
- Axios: To handle HTTP requests between the frontend and backend.
- Stripe: For integrating payment functionality securely.
- CSS Modules & Custom Styles: For styling the components.

Backend:
- Node.js with Express.js: A lightweight framework for building RESTful APIs.
- MongoDB: A NoSQL database to store user data, products, orders, etc.
- Mongoose: ODM (Object Data Modeling) for MongoDB, simplifying database operations.
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens): For secure user authentication.
- Express Rate Limiting: To prevent abuse and manage request rate limits.
- Stripe API: To process payments securely.

------------------------------------------------------------

Features

1. User Authentication
- Registration & Login: Users can register for an account and log in to access their profile and make purchases.
- JWT Authentication: Users are authenticated using JWT tokens, which are stored in local storage for session persistence.
- Profile Management: Users can view and update their profile, including their email, password, and shipping details.

2. Product Management
- Product Listing: Users can view a list of products with details such as price, description, and images.
- Admin Product Management: Admins can add, update, and delete products.

3. Shopping Cart
- Add Products to Cart: Users can add items to their shopping cart.
- Manage Cart Items: Modify quantities and remove items from the cart.
- Cart Summary: Displays the total price of the items in the cart.

4. Checkout & Payment
- Stripe Integration: The application integrates with Stripe for secure payment processing.
- Order Confirmation: Once payment is successful, the user receives an order confirmation.

5. Order Management
- Order History: Users can view a history of their previous orders, including details such as products, quantities, and order status.
- Admin Order Management: Admins can view all orders placed and track the status of the orders.

6. Security Enhancements
- Input Validation: Proper validation of user inputs (email, passwords, etc.) to prevent invalid data and SQL injections.
- Sanitization: Ensures user inputs are safe by removing any harmful or malicious content.
- Rate Limiting: Implemented to restrict the number of requests a user can make to the API in a given period, preventing brute-force attacks.
